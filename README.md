# Web Scraper

This is a Python web scraper that scrapes data from two specified athletes and then presents that data in a comparison chart.

## Installation

pip install beautifulsoup4

pip install mplsoccer

## Usage/Examples

Go to https://www.premierleague.com/players and choose a player. Input that link in the url variable inside the file 'scraper.py'.

Later in the code the url variable gets reassigned to another url. This is where you will input the link for the second player.

Now you can run the program to populate the CSV file.

All that's left to do is run the 'comparison_chart.py' file and the comparison chart of the two players will be presented.
